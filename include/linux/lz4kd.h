/* file lz4kd.h
  This file contains the platform-independent API of LZ-class
  lossless codecs (compressors/decompressors) with complete
  in-place documentation.  The documentation is formatted
  in accordance with DOXYGEN mark-up format.  So, one can
  generate proper documentation, e.g. in HTML format, using DOXYGEN.

  Currently, LZ-class codecs, documented here, implement following
  algorithms for lossless data compression/decompression:
  \li "LZ" proprietary codec competing with LZ4 - lz4kd_encode(),
  lz4kd_encode_delta(), lz4kd_decode(), lz4kd_decode_delta()

  The LZ compressors accept any data as input and compress it
  without loss to a smaller size if possible.
  Compressed data produced by LZ compressor API lz4kd_encode*(),
  can be decompressed only by lz4kd_decode() API documented below.\n
