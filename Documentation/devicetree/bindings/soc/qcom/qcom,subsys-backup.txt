Qualcomm Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Subsystem Backup-Restore Device binding

This binding describes the Qualcomm Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Subsystem
Backup-Restore Device bindings.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be:
		    "qcom,subsys-backup"

- memory-region:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: handle to memory region for allocating the memory for
		    backup and restore.

- qcom,buf-size:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: Size of each backup buffer.


= EXAMPLE
The following example shows allocating two 6MB memory region for backup and
restore purpose.

	reserved-memory {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges;

		subsys_backup_region: subsys_backup_region {
			compatible = "shared-dma-pool";
			reusable;
			size = <0xC00000>;
		};
	};

	soc {
		subsys_backup: qcom,subsys-backup {
			compatible = "qcom,subsys-backup";
			qcom,buf-size = <0x600000>;
			memory-region = <&subsys_backup_region>;
		};
	};
